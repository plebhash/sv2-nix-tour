<h1 align="center">
SV2 Nix Tour
</h1>

A guided journey on Stratum universe based on [Nix](https://nixos.org/). The goal is to help the reader assimilate key concepts around Bitcoin mining, [StratumV2 protocol specs](https://stratumprotocol.org/specification), and [Stratum Reference Implentation](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum) (SRI).

The markdown files are structured as a sequence of Nix-based mini-lessons around SRI.

Each lesson guides the reader through some steps, and proposes rethorical questions.

The [Discussions](https://github.com/plebhash/sv2-nix-tour/discussions) tab of the Github repository is used for the community to engage around these rethorical questions, and any other questions that come up during their journey through the Tour.
